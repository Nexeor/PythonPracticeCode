# These three lines convert the string values into floats so they can be used as numbers

# These two lines are divided ny 100 in order to convert them into decimals from percentages
tax = float(tax) / 100

# The converted values are then used to calculate the meal + tax, then meal + tax and tip

# The total, rounded value is then printed to the user
