# SETUP ----------------------------------

from random import randint  # Imports randomint

board = []  # Creates an empty list called board

# Makes the board a set of five lists
for x in range(0, 5):
    board.append(["O"] * 5)


def print_board(board):
    # Prints out the board list, but joins a space that puts the lists on five seperate lines
    for row in board:
        print " ".join(row)


print_board(board)  # Calls the print board function


def random_row(board):
    # Chooses a random row to place the ship
    return randint(0, len(board) - 1)


def random_col(board):
    # Chooses a random collumn to place the ship
    return randint(0, len(board[0]) - 1)


ship_row = random_row(board)  # Calls the random row function
ship_col = random_col(board)  # Calls the random collumn row function

# Tells you where the ship is for debugging:
# print ship_row
# print ship_col

# GAMEPLAY -------------------------------

for turn in range(4):  # Sets game to stop after 4 turns
    # Asks player for guess, then determines result
    print "Turn", turn + 1  # prints the turn timer, and ticks turn up by one
    guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row: "))  # The players guess, turns into int
    guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: "))

    if guess_row == ship_row and guess_col == ship_col:  # Checks to see if player input matches the answer
        print "Congratulations! You sank my battleship!"
        break  # Stops program when player gets it right
    else:
        if guess_row not in range(5) or guess_col not in range(5):  # Checks if player inputted answer on the board
            print "Oops, that's not even in the ocean."
        elif board[guess_row][guess_col] == "X":  # Checks if player entered new guess
            print("You guessed that one already.")
        else:
            print "You missed my battleship!"
            board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X"  # Changes the O to an X
    if (turn == 3):  # Checks to see if 4 turns have passed
        print "Game Over"
